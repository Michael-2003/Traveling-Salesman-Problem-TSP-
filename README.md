This Tkinter-based Python script implements the Traveling Salesman Problem using a brute-force approach, visualizing routes and displaying the shortest one.
It allows users to input a graph representing distances between cities, then calculates and displays the shortest route to visit all cities exactly once before returning to the starting point.
